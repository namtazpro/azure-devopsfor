# Source control for Notebooks (python) scripts

## Notebook in JupyterLab (python kernel)
JupyterLab is a Notebook IDE than can execute in WebBrowser or installed locally. An Git extension exists here https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git

You need to enable the extension from Extension Manager (April-2020 in Preview for WebBrowser version)

## Notebook in Azure Data Studio (python kernel)
Similar to Visual Studio Code, you integrate with a Git repo and manage your python scripts with the Explorer and Source Control views.
